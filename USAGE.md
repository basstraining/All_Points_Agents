## What You Can Ask

This assistant has access to a full 3PL operations environment — shipping, billing, compliance, carrier management, and more. Ask anything you'd normally dig through 5 different systems to answer.

### Operations & Shipping

- "Give me a Monday morning operations briefing"
- "Show me all critical shipment exceptions right now"
- "Look up tracking number 1Z999AA10123456784"
- "What shipments does TurtleBox Audio have with exceptions?"
- "How many shipments are delayed vs. on time?"

### Rate Shopping

- "Rate shop all open orders and show me the cheapest carriers"
- "What's the cheapest rate for order APO-2000?"
- "How much would we save if we always picked the cheapest carrier?"
- "Which carrier wins most often on price?"

### Chargebacks & Compliance

- "Show me chargebacks expiring this week"
- "Pull up the details on chargeback CB-10002 including evidence"
- "Which retailer is charging us back the most?"
- "What's our dispute win rate?"

### Profitability

- "How profitable is each client? Rank them by margin"
- "Break down labor costs by service type for NovaSkin Beauty"
- "Which clients have overdue invoices?"
- "Show me the full profitability overview"

### LTL Freight

- "Compare LTL carriers for PeakGear Outdoors across all lanes"
- "Show me confirmed LTL bookings pending pickup"
- "What's the average savings per lane if we always use the cheapest carrier?"

### Email Inbox

- "What unread emails need a human response?"
- "Show me emails about shipping issues"
- "How many emails were auto-resolved vs. need attention?"

### Cross-System Analysis

This is where it gets powerful — questions that span multiple systems:

- "Which clients have both low margins AND overdue invoices?"
- "Is the carrier that wins on rate shopping also causing the most exceptions?"
- "Give me a full health check across all 8 clients — margin, exceptions, chargebacks, invoice status"
- "TurtleBox Audio has a QBR next week. Pull together profitability, shipping performance, chargebacks, and labor breakdown"

## Sending Emails, Slack Messages, and Slide Decks

The assistant can send real emails, post to Slack, and build Google Slides presentations. The first time it tries to access one of these services, you'll see an authorization link.

**Here's what happens:**

1. You ask something like "Draft an email to the client about their delayed shipment and send it"
2. The assistant drafts the email and attempts to send it
3. If this is your first time, you'll see: **"Click here to authorize Gmail"**
4. Click the link → sign in with your Google account → approve access
5. Come back to the chat and ask again — this time it sends

You only need to authorize each service once. After that, it works automatically.

**What it can send to:**
- **Gmail** — client updates, exception notifications, chargeback summaries, weekly reports
- **Slack** — team alerts, channel updates, status summaries
- **Google Slides** — QBR decks, client review presentations, weekly operations summaries

## Tips

- **Be specific.** "Show me TurtleBox chargebacks" is better than "show me chargebacks."
- **Ask follow-ups.** After getting a summary, drill into specifics: "Tell me more about CB-10002."
- **Request actions.** Don't just ask for data — ask it to *do something* with it: "Email the client about this," "Post a summary in Slack," "Build a QBR deck."
- **Ask for comparisons.** "Compare carrier performance across all clients" or "Which service type costs the most labor?"
- **Request specific formats.** You can ask for tables, bullet points, or summaries.

## Privacy

- Your email is used only to identify your session and keep your connected accounts (Gmail, Slack, etc.) separate from other users.
- OAuth tokens for your Google/Slack accounts are managed by Arcade.dev's secure infrastructure (SOC 2 Type 2 certified). They are never stored in the chatbot itself.
- The operations data you see is a demo environment. Your personal tool connections (Gmail, Slack, Slides) are real and fully private to you.
